    "•\tMean: The sum of all values divided by the number of values. It gives the overall average of the dataset but can be affected by extreme values (outliers).\n",
    "o\tUse: Best for symmetric datasets without outliers.\n",

    "o\tExample: For the data [5,8,10,12,15][5, 8, 10, 12, 15][5,8,10,12,15], variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.\n",
    "•\tStandard Deviation: The square root of variance. It gives a sense of how much the data deviates from the mean in the same units as the data.\n",

    "Q6. What is a Venn diagram?\n",
    "A Venn diagram is a visual representation of the relationships between different sets. Each set is represented by a circle, and overlapping areas show elements that are common between sets.\n",

    "Skewness refers to the asymmetry in the distribution of data. It can be:\n",
    "•\tPositive (Right-skewed): Tail is on the right side, with more data points concentrated on the left.\n",

    "Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?\n",
    "•\tCovariance: Measures how two variables vary together. It can take any value and is sensitive to the scale of the variables.\n",
    "o\tExample: If two variables increase together, they have a positive covariance.\n",
    "•\tCorrelation: A standardized measure of the relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to +1. It indicates the strength and direction of a linear relationship.\n",

    "In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?\n",
    "Covariance measures how two variables vary together but is sensitive to the units of the variables, while correlation standardizes this relationship between -1 and 1, making it easier to interpret.\n",
